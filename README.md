# Data Visualization Dashboard

## Overview
The **Data Visualization Dashboard** is a web application designed to visualize and analyze data collected from various sources. It provides interactive charts and filters to help users gain insights into the data through key performance indicators (KPIs) and detailed visual representations. The dashboard uses technologies like Django, MongoDB, D3.js, and Plotly.js for an interactive experience.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or higher
- MongoDB (running locally on port 27017)
- Node.js and npm (for any additional JavaScript libraries)
  
### Python Packages
Install the necessary Python packages with pip:

```bash
pip install Django pymongo
```

### JavaScript Libraries
The project includes the following JavaScript libraries for visualizations:

- D3.js
- Plotly.js
- Bootstrap (for styling)

You can use CDN links for the JavaScript libraries included in the HTML.

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/
   ```

## Charts
The dashboard features various types of charts to visualize the data:

- **Bubble Chart**: Displays the relationship between impact and likelihood by sector.
- **Bar Chart**: Visualizes relevance over time and intensity by topic.
- **Donut Chart**: Shows the likelihood distribution by topic and distribution by region.
- **Scatter Plot**: Compares intensity against relevance.
- **Smooth Line Chart**: Displays intensity distribution over time.

### Example Charts:
- **Impact vs. Likelihood by Sector**
- **Relevance Over Time by Topic**
- **Top 5 Countries by Impact**
- **Intensity Distribution**
- **Likelihood Distribution by Topic**
- **Intensity by Topic**
- **Intensity vs. Relevance**

## Filters
The dashboard includes various filters to refine the displayed data:
- **End Year**: Filter results by the end year of the data.
- **Topic**: Select specific topics of interest.
- **Sector**: Narrow down to specific sectors.
- **Region**: Focus on data from certain regions.
- **PEST**: Filter by PEST analysis categories.
- **Source**: Choose the source of the data.
- **SWOT**: Apply SWOT analysis filters.
- **Country**: Filter data by specific countries.
- **City**: Select data related to specific cities.

## Future Enhancements
To improve the functionality and user experience of the dashboard, the following enhancements could be considered:

- **User Authentication**: Implement user login and access control.
- **Dynamic Data Updates**: Integrate real-time data updates using WebSockets or long polling.
- **Downloadable Reports**: Allow users to export the visualized data and charts as PDF or Excel reports.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Enable users to create and save custom dashboards based on their preferences.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize the dashboard for better usability on mobile devices.
- **Enhanced Data Filtering**: Implement advanced filtering options, such as multi-select dropdowns and range sliders.
